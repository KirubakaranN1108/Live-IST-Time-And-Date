## How It Works 📝

1. The application fetches the current system time and date using JavaScript's `Date` object.
2. It formats the time and date into a user-friendly format (e.g., 12-hour clock with zero-padding for single-digit values).
3. The `setInterval()` function is used to update the time and date every half-second.
4. The app adapts to various screen sizes with responsive CSS.
